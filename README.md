*My name is Kyle, an aspiring Red Teamer/Entrepreneur that is currently working towards breaking into cybersecurity.*

*This Github Page serves as my personal journal as well as a guide for aspiring individuals who want to break into cybersecurity.*

☑️ Golang

☑️ Bash

# ✔️ *10 Rules in Getting Into Cybersecurity:*

## 🥇 #1 is the most important rule for me *(my own opinion, also applies anywhere)*

1. Get started if you really want it. Get a feel of it when learning, when you feel it does not resonate in you, you can still do what you love.
2. Learn everyday even for a small amount of time. Small things add up to a bigger outcomes.
3. Accept the fact that the cybersecurity field is vast. We need to know the fundamentals and branch to a field that suits you. It is also okay to become overwhelmed by the topics and not knowing it all.
4. Take your time to learn a topic. No one becomes a successful writer by just writing for 1 day.
5. Take small steps when doing tasks. Never skip the basics (*dont be like me 😩, I learned the hard way*).
6. Have a network of like minded people. The more the merrier! (*skip on toxic ones though*)
7. Do not get discouraged by our failures. Failures are just reminders that we do not understand a topic fully. Embrace (*not emotionally but as a part of learning process*) your own failures and learn from them.
8. Be you own motivator. Give yourself a reason to become persistent on what you do.
9. Do not **compare** your achievements to others as it will hinder your success. Mind your own business. Keep moving forward.
10. Give back to the community that helped you break your way into cybersecurity.
